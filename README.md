# Housing Price Prediction

This project aims to predict housing prices using liner regression and gradient boosting algorithms.

## Overview

In this project, we utilize two different machine learning algorithms, linear regression and gradient boosting, to predict housing prices based on various features. We employ libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.

## Requirements

To run the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies via pip using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```git clone https://github.com/hmgtech/Linear-Regression-.git```


2. Install the required dependencies:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

3. Run the Python script containing the housing price prediction code.
